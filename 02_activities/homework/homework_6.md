**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

Looking back at my time managing an OTC exchange, I see how important it is to focus on ethics and fairness. Having access to sensitive data like private keys and client info made me realize that even small mistakes could seriously affect people's lives. If I had the chance to do it again, I’d prioritize better data management—making sure we keep everything updated and secure to protect our clients.

I’d also work on making our services more accessible. By creating easy-to-understand resources and support for new clients, especially those from underserved communities, we could help more people use our platform.

Building a culture that values data privacy and ethical behavior is key. Regular training sessions on ethics for the whole team would keep everyone on the same page about protecting client information. This way, we could create a safer and more inclusive environment for all our clients.
