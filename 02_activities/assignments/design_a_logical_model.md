# Assignment 1: Design a Logical Model

## Question 1
Create a logical model for a small bookstore. ðŸ“š

At the minimum it should have employee, order, sales, customer, and book entities (tables). Determine sensible column and table design based on what you know about these concepts. Keep it simple, but work out sensible relationships to keep tables reasonably sized. Include a date table. There are several tools online you can use, I'd recommend [_Draw.io_](https://www.drawio.com/) or [_LucidChart_](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/).

## Question 2
We want to create employee shifts, splitting up the day into morning and evening. Add this to the ERD.

## Question 3
The store wants to keep customer addresses. Propose two architectures for the CUSTOMER_ADDRESS table, one that will retain changes, and another that will overwrite. Which is type 1, which is type 2?

_Hint, search type 1 vs type 2 slowly changing dimensions._

Bonus: Are there privacy implications to this, why or why not?
```
Architecture Type 1 - Overwrite:
Each time a customer updates their address, the existing address is overwritten. This means we only have one record for the customer's address & will lose historical data.

Example: 
Table customer_address {
  CustomerID [pk]
  AddressLine1 
  AddressLine2 
  City 
  State 
  PostalCode 
  Country 
}

Architecture Type 2 - Keep Changes:
Keeps track of all address changes by creating a new record every time an address is updated. Each record has an effective date and expiration date to  indicate the period during which that record is valid or active.

Example:
Table customer_address {
  AddressID
  CustomerID 
  AddressLine1 
  City 
  Province 
  PostalCode 
  Country 
  EffectiveDate 
  ExpirationDate 
}

BONUS: Type 1 can be an issue if previois addresses are required. Type 2 can have privacy issues regarding old addreses still being accessible which can lead to that data being leaked. It also raises concerns on how long the old data will be stored.

```

## Question 4
Review the AdventureWorks Schema [here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/LMu4W.gif)

Highlight at least two differences between it and your ERD. Would you change anything in yours?
```

Difference 1 - Entities: 
The AdventureWoorks table consists of a largery arry of entities like Vendor, Promotion etc. that allows for more categorization of data. While my Bookstore ERD doesnt have those additional layers of categorization.

Difference 2 - Complexity:
The AdventureWorks schema has more complex relations as compared to my Bookstore ERD that has simpler one-to-many relationsions.

I would like to add more tables to my ERD to manage more many-to-many relations for greater store data managment capabilities. Also, adding more entities like Category for books to better segment the books.
